# SymbolWriter
A program that writes words and sentences in atomic symbols. After some atomic symbols memes like "You must be made out of copper and tellurium because you're really CuTe", I decided to create a program that checks if a word can be written using atomic symbols and which ones should be used to write it.

# MIT license and easy to compile
Compiling this program is easy. Aldo there isn't a Visual Studio / Mono Develop solution, you can easily compile the code using the command line with the default .NET compiler or with Mono:

`csc SymbolWriter.cs`

This program also uses the MIT license, which makes it easy to use my code under the condition that you include the license file.
